# archivist
Webpage archiver that focuses on content rather than the actual pages

## Note
archivist is still in a very early stage. Stuff can and will change. So now's the time to improve my garbage API. :wink:

## Usage
Put a tweets.jsonl into the working directory. Don't have one? I don't blame you. Instructions not coming soon, because there's going to be a sort of Save Page Now that it will use.

This project uses the Rocket web server, as it's fast and quite simple.

And of course it uses Rust, because Rust == good. Or should I say: `rust == Ratings::Good`
